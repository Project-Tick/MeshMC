# MMCOSign.cmake — attach a GPG signature trailer to a built .mmco
# target during the build, via scripts/mmco_sign.py.
#
# Usage:
#
#   include(MMCOSign)
#   mmco_sign_plugin(MyPluginTarget
#       KEY     "DEADBEEF..."         # explicit GPG fingerprint (optional)
#       HOMEDIR "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/.gnupg"  # optional
#   )
#
# The signing pipeline has TWO stages:
#
#   1. POST_BUILD custom command — signs the staged .mmco under
#      ${MESHMC_PLUGIN_STAGING_DIR} so the in-tree run finds a signed
#      plugin straight out of the build directory.
#
#   2. install(CODE …) hook — re-signs the *installed* copy after
#      CMake has done its RPATH-rewriting / debug-stripping surgery.
#      That surgery rewrites bytes inside the GPG-signed payload, so
#      without this step the installed plugin would always fail
#      verification with BadSignature.
#
# Both steps use the same key + GnuPG homedir. The function is a
# no-op when no key is configured — unsigned developer builds keep
# working, and the launcher will only enforce signatures on non-OSS
# modules at runtime.
#
# Re-signing at install time can be suppressed with the environment
# variable MESHMC_SKIP_INSTALL_RESIGN=1 — useful for distro packagers
# who don't have the upstream signing key handy. The installed plugin
# will then fail signature verification at runtime (which is the
# correct fail-safe behaviour for a plugin without a valid trailer).
#
# Cache-driven workflow for CI / release builds:
#
#   cmake -DMeshMC_PLUGIN_SIGNING_KEY=<fpr>             \
#         -DMeshMC_PLUGIN_SIGNING_HOMEDIR=<dir>         \
#         -DMeshMC_PLUGIN_SIGN_ALL=ON                   \
#         ...
#
# When MeshMC_PLUGIN_SIGN_ALL is ON, plugins/CMakeLists.txt walks every
# in-tree .mmco target and calls mmco_sign_plugin() on it automatically.

    # ─── 2. Install-tree re-signing ─────────────────────────────────
    #
    # When CMake installs a MODULE library it may:
    #
    #   • Rewrite RPATH / RUNPATH (chrpath / patchelf on Linux,
    #     install_name_tool on macOS) so the installed copy resolves
    #     dependencies relative to the install prefix instead of the
    #     build tree, and
    #   • Strip debug symbols (CMAKE_INSTALL_DO_STRIP=ON, cpack-driven
    #     builds, distro packaging).
    #
    # Both operations rewrite bytes inside the very same payload that
    # the POST_BUILD signature covers, so the trailer we attached at
    # build time is no longer valid against the installed file. The
    # detached GPG signature can't accommodate that — it's a hash of
    # the exact payload bytes.
    #
    # The fix is to re-sign at install time, *after* CMake has done
    # all its RPATH / strip surgery. We schedule a CODE block that
    # locates the freshly-installed file (honouring DESTDIR + prefix)
    # and invokes mmco_sign.py against it in place.
    #
    # Skipping the re-sign is supported via the environment variable
    # MESHMC_SKIP_INSTALL_RESIGN=1 — useful when packagers don't have
    # the signing key handy. The launcher will then reject the
    # installed plugin as BadSignature at load time, which is the
    # correct fail-safe.
    #
    # In-tree plugins all share the convention
    #   LIBRARY DESTINATION "${MMCO_MODULES_DEST_DIR}"
    # (defined alongside BINARY_DEST_DIR in the top-level CMakeLists)
    # so we can predict the install path at configure time. If you
    # break that convention in a custom plugin, override the

    # mmco_sign_plugin (left as a TODO for now — drop us an issue
    # if you need it).
