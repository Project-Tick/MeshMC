/*
 * ─── Plugins that graduated into core ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every module listed here once shipped as an in-tree .mmco plugin and
 * has since been absorbed into the launcher binary. Their old .mmco
 * files may still be sitting in a user's mmcmodules/ directory (or in a
 * distro package that has not caught up yet), and loading one now would
 * double up on everything core already does: two "Backups" tabs in the
 * instance dialog, two pre-launch snapshots per launch, two news
 * dialogs fighting over the same toolbar button.
 *
 * So the loader refuses to initialise them and reports the reason in
 * the plugins dialog instead of silently ignoring the file.
 *
 * Matching is case-insensitive and checks both the module's declared
 * name (MMCO_DEFINE_MODULE) and its file name, because a renamed .mmco
 * would otherwise slip past.
 *
 * ── Adding an entry ──
 * When a plugin graduates, append it here in the same commit that adds
 * its core implementation. Keep the detail string short: it is shown
 * verbatim in the plugins dialog next to the module name.
