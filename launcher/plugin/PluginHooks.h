 * a separate row in the launcher's progress dialog, so a slow callback
 * (archiving an instance, shelling out to git, hashing files) no
 * longer freezes the window.
 *
 * A background callback MUST NOT touch any ui_*, tray_* or
 * main_window_* function, must not create or mutate Qt widgets, and
 * must not assume anything about its thread beyond "not the GUI
 * thread". It MAY use log_*, fs_*, zip_*, process_run and
 * progress_report.
 *
 * Everything else — the settings getters and setters, and every
 * instance / account / mod / world accessor — reads launcher state
 * that only the GUI thread owns. Register a second, inline callback
 * for the same hook, read what you need there, and hand it to the
 * background one: the host runs all inline callbacks of a dispatch
 * before any background one.
 *
 * Dispatch still waits for every background callback to finish before
 * it returns, so the ordering guarantees callers rely on (e.g.
 * LaunchController reading pending env right after PRE_LAUNCH) are
 * unchanged.
 *
 * Omitting the flag — or using the plain hook_register — keeps the
 * legacy behaviour: the callback runs inline, blocking the caller.
