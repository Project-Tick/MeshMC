	 * ask the catalogue what other versions exist and to replace the
	 * instance with one of them in place - which is what
	 * ManagedPackPage does.
	 *
	 * These read the pack-source keys registered in the constructor.
	 * Deliberately thin wrappers rather than a cached struct:
	 * isManagedPack() is asked on every repaint of a page that shows
	 * an instance, and a settings lookup is already a hash probe.
	 *
	 * Every field is allowed to be empty. An older MeshMC recorded
	 * fewer of them, and a pack imported by drag-and-drop never had a
	 * catalogue entry to record in the first place, so the page has to
	 * cope with partial records rather than assume all-or-nothing.
