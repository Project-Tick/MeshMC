/*!
 * The standalone updater.
 *
 * Runs in one of three modes, all driven from the same release list so that
 * they can never disagree with each other:
 *
 *   --check-only        report whether an update exists, and exit. Used by
 *                       the launcher; the answer is the exit status (see
 *                       ExitCode) and the details go to stdout.
 *   --list              print the available releases and exit.
 *   (default)           install an update, then restart the launcher.
 *
 * Installing is itself two passes through this binary. The first runs from
 * the installation being replaced: it downloads a release, backs the current
 * files up, unpacks the new ones into a staging directory, and then starts
 * the *unpacked* updater and exits -- which is what releases the libraries
 * this process had mapped. The second pass finds the marker file left in the
 * staging directory, copies everything into the installation (nothing there
 * is mapped by it), and launches the launcher again.
 *
 * A single-process updater cannot do this on Windows: the files it has to
 * replace include the Qt libraries it is running from, and a mapped image
 * cannot be deleted. It would die partway through and leave an installation
 * that is neither version.
