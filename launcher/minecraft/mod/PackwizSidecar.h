/*
 * Packwiz sidecar translation layer.
 *
 * packwiz keeps one TOML file per managed file in the pack's index folder,
 * named after the project slug (`sodium.pw.toml`). That file is the format
 * other tools in this ecosystem read and write, so this is the on-disk
 * shape of our own provenance sidecars: an instance's `mods/.index/` stays
 * readable by packwiz itself and by launchers that follow it, and packs
 * that arrive with such an index are understood without a conversion step.
 *
 * The canonical part of the format is small:
 *
 *     name = "Sodium"
 *     filename = "sodium-fabric-0.5.8.jar"
 *     side = "client"
 *
 *     [download]
 *     mode = "url"                 # or "metadata:curseforge"
 *     url = "https://..."
 *     hash-format = "sha512"
 *     hash = "..."
 *
 *     [update.modrinth]            # or [update.curseforge]
 *     mod-id = "AANobbMI"
 *     version = "..."
 *
 * Everything we track beyond that (whether a file came in as a transitive
 * dependency, when it was installed, its size) lives under `x-meshmc-*`
 * keys, which is the extension namespace the format reserves; foreign
 * readers skip them instead of choking on them.
 *
 * Note that `hash-format` is load-bearing rather than decorative. Other
 * launchers record whatever digest the provider hands them - Modrinth is
 * asked for SHA-512 first - so a sidecar's hash is frequently not a SHA-1.
 * Reading one into a field that the download verifier treats as SHA-1
 * would make every affected file fail its integrity check, so the pair is
 * kept together and `Entry::sha1` is only populated when the format
 * actually says sha1.
