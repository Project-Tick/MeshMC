/* Everything the launcher hardcodes about one mod loader.
 *
 * These facts used to be scattered, and the copies had drifted apart.
 * VersionPage decided which loaders exist by having one toolbar action
 * each, and gated them on Minecraft version numbers written into the
 * source. ModFolderPage and DownloadContentDialog each carried their own
 * if-chain mapping component uids to platform names, in two different
 * orders, and neither asked whether the component was enabled - so a
 * loader the user had switched off still counted as installed in one
 * place while blocking an install in another.
 *
 * Collecting them means adding a loader is appending one row, and it
 * means the answers can no longer disagree with each other.
 *
 * Field notes:
 *
 * - platformId is what CurseForge and Modrinth call the loader. Empty
 *   for LiteLoader on purpose: Modrinth has no facet for it and
 *   ModPlatform::loaderToCurseForgeModLoaderType() returns 0 for it, so
 *   passing it to a search removes every result. Empty therefore means
 *   "installed, but there is nothing to search with", which is how the
 *   download paths already behaved - this table is not the place to
 *   quietly change that.
 *
 * - brandName is not run through tr(). These are product names, spelled
 *   the same in every language; translating them would only invite a
 *   mistranslation that no longer matches the metadata.
 *
 * - earliestMinecraft is empty whenever the metadata can speak for
 *   itself. Forge, NeoForge and LiteLoader publish one build per
 *   Minecraft version, so filtering on the parent version already yields
 *   an empty list for a game version they never supported. Fabric and
 *   Quilt publish loader builds that name no Minecraft version at all,
 *   so there is nothing to filter on and the floor has to be stated.
 *
 * - conflictsWith is symmetric, and is kept so by hand; nothing derives
 *   one direction from the other. */
