 *
 * An earlier version of this file expressed the layout as a formula -- "a box
 * unwrap is a cross, so face N of a w*h*d box sits at offset X" -- and then
 * generated the legacy limb copies and the thumbnail source rectangles from
 * it. That is the wrong shape for this problem. The formula was an
 * interpretation of the format, so any mistake in it was invisible: there was
 * nothing to hold the output up against, and a single wrong term silently
 * moved every limb at once.
 *
 * A format is data. It is written out as data, so that it can be read against
 * the format and checked a line at a time.
