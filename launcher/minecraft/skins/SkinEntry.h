/* One skin in the local skin library.
 *
 * A skin is a PNG file on disk plus three pieces of metadata that the file
 * itself cannot carry: which arm width the player model should use, which
 * cape was worn with it, and the profile texture URL it was last uploaded
 * as. The URL is what lets the library recognise "this saved skin is the
 * one the account is currently wearing" after a restart, since the account
 * only ever tells us a URL.
 *
 * The file name (without extension) is the identity of the entry: it is the
 * display name, the key the library and the dialog pass around, and what
 * renaming changes. Nothing else is unique -- two files can easily hold the
 * same pixels.
 *
 * Deliberately a plain value type, not a QObject: the library keeps these in
 * a QList and hands out raw pointers into it, and copies are made freely
 * while rebuilding that list.
