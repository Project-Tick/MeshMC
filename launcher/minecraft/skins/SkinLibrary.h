/* The local skin library: every skin the user has saved, as a list model.
 *
 * Backed by a directory of PNG files plus an "index.json" holding the
 * metadata that a PNG cannot carry (arm width, cape, profile URL). The
 * directory is the source of truth for *which* skins exist -- files dropped
 * in by hand show up on the next rescan, and files deleted by hand disappear
 * -- while the index only decorates the files it recognises. That way the
 * library can never end up insisting on skins that are not there.
 *
 * The account is needed for more than display: whatever skin the account is
 * currently wearing is adopted into the library on rescan, so a fresh install
 * opens with the user's own skin already in the list and already selected.
 *
 * Entries are keyed by name (the file name without ".png"), which is also
 * what the model reports for Qt::UserRole. Callers hold names, not pointers
 * or row numbers, because a rescan can reorder or replace the whole list.
