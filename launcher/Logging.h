/*
 * Logging categories for the launcher's own output.
 *
 * A category does two things for us: it tags the line in the log, so a reader
 * can tell our noise apart from Qt's, and it gives users a filter they can
 * aim, for example
 *
 *     QT_LOGGING_RULES="meshmc.net.debug=false"
 *
 * to silence one subsystem without losing its warnings.
 *
 * To add one: declare it here, define it in Logging.cpp with the matching
 * "meshmc.<subsystem>" string, then use qCDebug(<name>) instead of qDebug()
 * in that subsystem. Uncategorised qDebug() keeps working and keeps printing
 * exactly as it did - Qt reports its category as "default", which the log
 * layout treats as "no category" and omits.
 *
 * NOTE: only declare categories that are actually in use. An unused category
 * is a promise about where messages come from that nothing keeps.

	 *
	 * withSourceLocation is a per-message decision, not a per-build one: Qt's
	 * own libraries are built without QT_MESSAGELOGCONTEXT, so anything
	 * raised inside Qt arrives with an empty context and must be rendered
	 * without the suffix, or every such line ends in a useless "(unknown:0)".
	 * The caller decides by looking at QMessageLogContext::line.

	 * This is not a formality on Windows: a console does not interpret escape
	 * sequences until someone sets ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING on it,
	 * and the classic console host starts with that bit clear. Printing
	 * colour anyway is how a log line ends up reading "<ESC>[32mD:<ESC>[0m".
