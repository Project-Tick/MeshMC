/* Which file of a project to install, when nobody picked one.
 *
 * The dependency resolver and the update checker both used to take
 * whatever the provider happened to list first. Neither API promises an
 * order, and CurseForge in particular will hand back a file for another
 * loader among the matches, so "first" quietly meant "a build that may
 * not even run here".
 *
 * What both of these do instead, and what the reference launcher does:
 * throw away entries built for a different loader, then take the one
 * published most recently. Deliberately not a version-string
 * comparison - mod version numbering is not semver often enough that
 * sorting by it puts "1.9" above "1.10", while the publish date is
 * stated by both providers and means the same thing on each. */
