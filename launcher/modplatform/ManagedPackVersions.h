/* The list of versions a modpack has, in a shape that does not depend on
 * which catalogue answered.
 *
 * The existing Flame::IndexedPack / Modrinth::IndexedPack pair already
 * models "a pack and its versions", but each is shaped around what its
 * own browse page needs: Flame keeps ids as ints and has no version
 * number distinct from the display name, Modrinth keeps a single game
 * version rather than the list, and neither carries a changelog. The
 * managed-pack page needs the union of those, plus the changelog, and it
 * has to show one combo box whose entries read the same whichever
 * provider filled it. Widening both existing structs would push
 * provider-specific holes into the browse pages that are happy today, so
 * this is a separate model that the two parsers below normalise into.
 *
 * No networking lives here. Fetching is the caller's business - the same
 * split ContentApi makes - because the two providers need a different
 * number of requests to answer the same question and the page is the
 * thing that knows how to show progress for that. */
