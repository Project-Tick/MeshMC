/*
 * The paste.ee key used for uploaded logs -- the QML equivalent of the
 * classic PasteEEPage, which only ever has this one setting (PasteEEAPIKey:
 * either the literal string "meshmc", or a key of the account's own).
 *
 * `ownKey` is local UI state, not a live binding to the stored setting: it
 * only tracks which radio is selected, synced from the setting once at
 * startup and from then on changed only by picking a radio here. Deriving
 * it from the setting on every read instead would snap the "own key" radio
 * back to "MeshMC key" the moment it is picked but before a key has been
 * typed in, since the setting itself has not changed yet.
