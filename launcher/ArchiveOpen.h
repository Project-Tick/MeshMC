/*!
 * Opening an archive by file name, on a path that is not necessarily ASCII.
 *
 * archive_read_open_filename() and archive_write_open_filename() take a
 * `char*`, and on Windows libarchive hands that to the narrow CRT/Win32
 * entry points, which decode it in the process's active ANSI code page --
 * not UTF-8. So `path.toUtf8()` is the one encoding those functions are
 * guaranteed to get wrong there: a perfectly ordinary
 *
 *     C:\Users\Şafak\AppData\Roaming\MeshMC\instances\...
 *
 * arrives mangled and the open fails with "No such file or directory",
 * for no reason other than the letter in the user's name. Every archive
 * MeshMC touches lives under the data directory, which lives under the
 * user profile, so this is not an edge case for the people it hits -- it
 * is every zip they ever open: instance import and export, modded jar
 * creation, and the update they are being offered.
 *
 * libarchive's own answer is the `_w` overloads, which go through
 * _wfopen()/CreateFileW(). Windows gets those; everywhere else the byte
 * path is already UTF-8 (or whatever QFile::encodeName would produce for
 * it) and the narrow form is correct as it stands.
 *
 * The Q_OS_WIN32 guard is load-bearing, not tidiness. On POSIX libarchive
 * implements the `_w` entry points by converting the wide name back to a
 * multi-byte string through the C locale, which is not the same thing as
 * UTF-8 and is not even set up in most of the environments this runs in:
 * measured on Linux, archive_write_open_filename_w() refuses a non-ASCII
 * name outright with "Can't convert '/tmp/?afak-?.zip' to MBS" while the
 * narrow call with the same path in UTF-8 bytes succeeds. Reaching for the
 * wide form on both platforms would have traded a Windows bug for a Linux
 * one.
 *
 * Both open-by-name directions are wrapped, not just the read side: an
 * export that cannot create its output is the same bug seen from the
 * other end.
 *
 * Still not handled: paths longer than MAX_PATH, which need a `\\?\`
 * prefix that libarchive does not add for us.
