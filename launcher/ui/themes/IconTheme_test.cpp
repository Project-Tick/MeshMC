/*
 * Can Qt's own icon engine serve the icon themes MeshMC ships inside qrc?
 *
 * For most of this launcher's history the answer was assumed to be no, and
 * every themed icon went through XdgIcon instead -- a fork of Qt's
 * QIconLoader, carried in libraries/iconfix, which existed for two reasons:
 * it put ":/icons" on the theme search path, and it never let a desktop
 * platform plugin substitute its own icon engine. Qt can be asked for both
 * of those directly, so the fork is gone and ThemeManager::setIconTheme()
 * asks. This test is what made that safe to do, and it is what keeps it
 * safe: everything below is the contract the fork used to guarantee by
 * owning the lookup itself.
 *
 * Deliberately written against the *public Qt API only*. Nothing here may
 * reach for a launcher class to resolve an icon: the point is to pin what Qt
 * does, so that a Qt upgrade that changes icon lookup fails here, in one
 * place, with a name and a theme in the message.
 *
 * What each case is worth:
 *
 *  - resourcesArePresent / searchPathAcceptsResourcePrefix
 *      the qrc themes are reachable at all, and are laid out the way the
 *      XDG spec (and therefore Qt's loader) requires.
 *  - unknownIconDoesNotResolve
 *      the NEGATIVE CONTROL, and the most important case here. Every other
 *      assertion is of the form "this name resolves". If the way this test
 *      asks that question answered "yes" unconditionally -- which is exactly
 *      what happens when a platform icon engine takes over and reports names
 *      it cannot actually draw -- all of them would pass while proving
 *      nothing. This case fails in that situation.
 *  - uiIconsResolveInEveryTheme / instanceIconsResolveInEveryTheme
 *      the actual coverage measurement, per theme and per name. Asks two
 *      questions of each: is there an image behind the name, and is it the
 *      image that was asked for. The second matters because of
 *      dashedNamesFallBackToTheirPrefix, below.
 *  - mainWindowUiIconNamesWereRead / mainWindowUiIconNamesAreAudited /
 *    mainWindowUiIconsResolveInEveryTheme /
 *    mainWindowOptionalIconsThatGoBlank
 *      the same coverage question asked of MainWindow.ui instead of a list
 *      kept by hand here. MainWindow::applyThemedIcons() takes its icon
 *      names from a "meshmcIcon" dynamic property in the XML, so the
 *      compiler never sees them and a misspelling costs one blank button
 *      and one qWarning. These read the .ui back and make it a test
 *      failure instead. They need MESHMC_MAINWINDOW_UI_PATH, which
 *      launcher/CMakeLists.txt passes in.
 *  - missingIconIsNull
 *      a handful of pages ask for an icon and ask for a different one if
 *      that came back empty. This is the contract those branches rest on,
 *      and the quietest thing this migration could have broken.
 *  - dashedNamesFallBackToTheirPrefix
 *      Qt applies the XDG rule that a missing "foo-bar" falls back to "foo".
 *      The retired fork did not, so this is the one lookup behaviour the
 *      migration genuinely changed, and the failure mode it introduced is
 *      silent: the wrong icon, drawn without complaint.
 *  - inheritsIsFollowedAcrossThemes
 *      ten of the eleven bundled themes carry only their own overrides and
 *      declare "Inherits=multimc" for the rest, so Qt's loader has to read
 *      and follow Inherits inside qrc or most themes lose most icons.
 *  - themeSwitchIsNotCachedByName
 *      QIcon::fromTheme keeps a process-wide cache keyed by icon *name*.
 *      Every per-theme result above is only meaningful if switching the
 *      theme invalidates that cache; otherwise the first theme's icons are
 *      handed out for all eleven and the coverage numbers are fiction.
 *
 * Where this runs matters, and the two environments answer different
 * questions:
 *
 *   offscreen (how ctest registers it)  -- deterministic; measures layout,
 *       coverage and Inherits. No desktop platform theme is loaded, so it
 *       says nothing about the fork's second reason for existing.
 *   a real session (run the binary directly, e.g.
 *       QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland ./IconTheme_test)
 *       -- measures whether the desktop's platform theme hijacks icon
 *       lookup. On Plasma that would be KIconEngine, which resolves against
 *       KDE's icon directories and knows nothing about ":/icons".
 *
 * initTestCase() prints which of the two it got, so a passing run can be
 * told apart from a passing run that measured nothing.
