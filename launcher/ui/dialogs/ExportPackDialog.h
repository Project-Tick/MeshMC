/*
 * Exporting an instance as a modpack for one of the catalogues.
 *
 * The plain-zip export (ExportInstanceDialog) writes the instance out as
 * it is. A pack is a different thing: it carries a manifest naming the
 * mods it expects to be downloaded on install, so it needs a name, a
 * version and - since it is going to be published - a say in what does
 * and does not go in it. Hence the same checkable tree as the zip
 * export, sharing its `.packignore`, but rooted at the game directory
 * rather than the instance directory: nothing above `.minecraft` has any
 * meaning to another launcher.
 *
 * One dialog serves both formats because the questions are nearly the
 * same. The differences are that Modrinth publishes a summary and
 * CurseForge does not, CurseForge records an author and a recommended
 * memory figure and Modrinth does not, and only Modrinth requires the
 * version field to be filled in. Those fields are hidden rather than
 * disabled for the format that has no use for them - a greyed-out box
 * still asks a question - and what the user typed is remembered per
 * instance either way.
