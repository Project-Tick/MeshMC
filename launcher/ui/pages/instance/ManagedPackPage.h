 * CurseForge.
 *
 * Shows what pack and which version of it is installed, lists the other
 * versions the catalogue has, renders the changelog of whichever one is
 * selected, and replaces the instance with that version in place.
 *
 * One class covers both providers rather than a base plus a subclass
 * each. The two differ in exactly three respects - the endpoint that
 * lists versions, how the reply is shaped, and whether a changelog
 * arrives with the list or needs its own request - and all three are
 * narrow enough to name in a switch. Splitting them into subclasses
 * would duplicate the whole of the fetch/select/render cycle to vary
 * those three points, and that duplication is where the two halves
 * would drift apart.
 *
 * There is also a second, quieter mode. An instance can have a provider
 * recorded but no pack id (imported from a local .mrpack, or imported
 * by a MeshMC old enough not to have recorded one). There is no
 * catalogue to query, so instead of a version list the page offers a URL
 * field and "Update From File" - which is the only route such an
 * instance has to a newer version. */
