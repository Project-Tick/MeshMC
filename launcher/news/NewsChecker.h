 * NewsChecker — downloads and parses the launcher's RSS feed, plus any
 * extra feeds configured at build time (MeshMC_NEWS_EXTRA_FEEDS).
 *
 * Feed 0 is the launcher's own feed and is the one the news bar in the
 * main window speaks for: if it fails, the whole load is reported as
 * failed. Extra feeds are additive — one of them being unreachable
 * leaves the rest of the news perfectly usable, so it is logged and
 * otherwise ignored rather than blanking the news bar.
 *
 * getNewsEntries() returns every feed's entries merged and sorted
 * newest first, each tagged with the index of the feed it came from.
